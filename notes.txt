1.ERC-121 STANDARD :- We are using this to create the non fungible tokens 

2. I.P.F.S : (decentralized file storage system) mainly to store the image so less data size to upload
    =>Now we dont want to store the meta data(like extra information about the real estate property like size of each room etc) on the block so will 
    =>will store it here and then put a reference in the block so can be accessed
    =>same way as we store URL for image or vidoe on mongodb but the video is on cloudinary but they are just centralized this one isnt

3.In the iginition file using m.getPatameters does not work 
so to solve it do the same prcoess like create paramater.json file in ignition and then import it and then use it normalyy

4.but when we have already connected our metamask to app with 
const accounts = await window.ethereum.request({method:'eth_requestAccounts'}); 
this then why to do this  const provider = new ethers.BrowserProvider(window.ethereum); ??

ANS=>
    Why do we need the provider even after connecting MetaMask?
    When you connect MetaMask to your app with:
    
    const accounts = await window.ethereum.request({ method: 'eth_requestAccounts' });
    This allows your app to access the user's MetaMask account (the wallet address) and get the list of accounts. However, this doesn't give your app the ability to interact with the Ethereum blockchain itself in a structured way. The connection to MetaMask enables access to the wallet, but to interact with the blockchain (e.g., reading smart contract data, sending transactions), you need a provider.

    Here’s what each part does:

    1. MetaMask Connection (eth_requestAccounts):
    What it does: This just connects your app to MetaMask and allows access to the user's Ethereum accounts. It gives you their account address (like 0x123...).
    What it doesn't do: It doesn't let you interact with the Ethereum network (read/write data on the blockchain). You still need a provider to connect to the network.
    2. Provider (ethers.BrowserProvider(window.ethereum)):
    What it does: A provider gives you access to the Ethereum network (the blockchain). This is what allows you to read data from the blockchain, interact with smart contracts, etc.
    What it doesn't do: It doesn’t give you the ability to send transactions (change the state of the blockchain). For that, you need a signer.
    Why both?
    MetaMask is like your Ethereum wallet (where your accounts and private keys are stored).
    Provider is like the "bridge" to the Ethereum network, enabling your app to communicate with the blockchain and get information (like balances, contract data, etc.).
    3.
    Signer: A signer is like a "creator" or "changer" on the blockchain. It allows you to send transactions (such as transferring tokens or updating data in a smart contract).
    When you send a transaction, you're signing it with your private key to prove it's you who is initiating the action.
    Example in a Real-World Scenario:
    Provider: Think of it like a library where you go to read books (get information from the blockchain). You can only look at books (data) but cannot write in them.
    Signer: A signer is like the librarian who can write or update information in the books (signing and sending transactions to the blockchain).



4.NetworkchainId: (...)name: (...)plugins: (...)[[Prototype]]: Object 
how am i still getting this in the console when i stoped the local network and disconnected the account from meta mask ??    const provider = new ethers.BrowserProvider(window.ethereum);
    setProvider(provider);

ANS=>
    Understanding the Scenario:
    MetaMask and window.ethereum:

    window.ethereum is an object provided by MetaMask that interacts with the Ethereum network. Even when you're not connected to a network or have disconnected your MetaMask account, MetaMask itself remains active in the browser.
    window.ethereum can still expose some basic details about the current state of MetaMask, such as the network MetaMask was last connected to.
    Provider with ethers.BrowserProvider(window.ethereum):

    When you create a provider using new ethers.BrowserProvider(window.ethereum), it interacts with MetaMask and can still retrieve details about the last known network that MetaMask was connected to. This includes information like chainId, name, etc.
    Even if the local network is stopped or the account is disconnected, MetaMask may still provide this data as it holds information about the last known state (network and account).
    Hardhat Network and MetaMask:

    When you're using Hardhat's local network with npx hardhat node, MetaMask could have been connected to it previously.
    If the local network is stopped but MetaMask still has the last network state cached, the provider might still retrieve this cached information.


5.what does this chunck of code does??
<strong>
    {new Date(Date.now() + 345600000).toLocaleDateString(undefined, {
    weekday: "long",
    month: "long",
    day: "numeric",
    })}
</strong> explain what this code does

ANS=>
    This code snippet generates a formatted date string by adding a certain number of milliseconds to the current date and time, then formatting the result into a human-readable format using toLocaleDateString.

    Step-by-step breakdown:
    Date.now():

    This retrieves the current timestamp in milliseconds since January 1, 1970 (Unix Epoch).
    Example: If the current time is December 20, 2024, 12:00 PM UTC, Date.now() might return something like 1734734400000.
    + 345600000:

    345600000 is the number of milliseconds to add.
    This is equivalent to 4 days because:
    1 day = 24 hours × 60 minutes × 60 seconds × 1000 milliseconds = 86,400,000 ms
    4 days = 345,600,000 ms
    Adding this value to Date.now() shifts the date 4 days into the future.
    new Date():

    A new Date object is created using the calculated timestamp (current time + 4 days).
    This represents the future date 4 days from now.
    .toLocaleDateString(undefined, {...}):

    The toLocaleDateString method converts the Date object into a human-readable string, formatted based on locale and options.
    undefined: This allows the browser to use the user's default locale.
    The second argument is an options object that specifies how the date should be formatted:
    weekday: "long": Displays the full name of the weekday (e.g., "Monday").
    month: "long": Displays the full name of the month (e.g., "December").
    day: "numeric": Displays the day of the month as a number (e.g., "20").
    <strong>...</strong>:

    Wraps the final formatted date string in a <strong> HTML tag, making it bold.

    A locale refers to the language and region-specific settings that determine how certain data, like dates, numbers, or currencies, is formatted and displayed. It is essentially a combination of language and cultural conventions.

    Example of Locales:
    Locales are typically represented as language codes and region codes, separated by a hyphen:

    en-US: English as used in the United States.
    en-GB: English as used in the United Kingdom.
    fr-FR: French as used in France.
    hi-IN: Hindi as used in India.
    Why is it Important?
    Different locales have different conventions for how they display things. For example:

    Date formatting:

    en-US (US English): December 20, 2024
    en-GB (UK English): 20 December 2024
    de-DE (German): 20. Dezember 2024
    Number formatting:

    en-US: 1,000.50 (comma for thousands, period for decimals)
    fr-FR: 1 000,50 (space for thousands, comma for decimals)
    de-DE: 1.000,50 (period for thousands, comma for decimals)
    Currency formatting:

    en-US: $1,000.50
    fr-FR: 1 000,50 €
    ja-JP: ￥1,000
    In the Code:
    When you use toLocaleDateString, it formats the date based on a given locale:

    If undefined is passed (like in your example), the browser uses the default locale of the user's device or browser settings.
    For example, if your browser's locale is set to en-US, the date will be displayed in the US format.


5. for understanding orders in product line number 30
ANS=>
    Example:
    Let’s assume the Order struct is defined like this:

    solidity
    Copy code
    struct Order {
        uint256 itemId;
        uint256 quantity;
        uint256 price;
        uint256 timestamp;
    }
    Now, imagine this data stored in your contract:

    solidity
    Copy code
    orders[0xUserAddress1][1] = Order({
        itemId: 101,
        quantity: 2,
        price: 2000000000000000000, // 2 ETH in wei
        timestamp: 1672531200      // Unix timestamp
    });

    orders[0xUserAddress1][2] = Order({
        itemId: 102,
        quantity: 1,
        price: 1000000000000000000, // 1 ETH in wei
        timestamp: 1672532200      // Unix timestamp
    });
    Here:

    User 0xUserAddress1 has two orders:
    Order ID: 1
    Item ID: 101
    Quantity: 2
    Price: 2 ETH
    Timestamp: 1672531200
    Order ID: 2
    Item ID: 102
    Quantity: 1
    Price: 1 ETH
    Timestamp: 1672532200
    How the orders Function Works:
    When you call:

    javascript
    Copy code
    const order = await dappazon.orders(account, orderId);
    The smart contract function fetches data for the specific buyer (account) and their orderId. In Solidity, this might look like:

    solidity
    Copy code
    function orders(address buyer, uint256 orderId) public view returns (Order memory) {
        return orders[buyer][orderId];
    }
    For example:

    If account = 0xUserAddress1 and orderId = 2, the function will return:
    json
    Copy code
    {
    "itemId": 102,
    "quantity": 1,
    "price": 1000000000000000000, // 1 ETH in wei
    "timestamp": 1672532200
    }


6.WHY DID WE PUT fetchDetails UNDER CALLBACK and what happens if we dont

React ensures that the useEffect hook always behaves predictably by running it when dependencies in the array change. If a function (like fetchDetails) is declared outside the hook but used inside it, React considers it a dependency because it might change.

In this case:

You are calling fetchDetails inside useEffect.
ESLint notices it and suggests adding it to the dependency array.
If you add fetchDetails as a dependency, but it's declared inline, the function reference will change on every render unless properly memoized.
How to Resolve It?
Here are the recommended approaches to handle this warning:

Option 1: Memoize the fetchDetails Function
You can use useCallback to memoize fetchDetails, ensuring that its reference remains stable and doesn't change on every render.
